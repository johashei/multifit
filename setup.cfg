description = Tool for fitting multiple data sets with shared parameters simultaneously
long_description = The goal of Multifit is to provide a convenient way of calculating fits with shared parameters over multiple data sets. The actual fitting is all done using the iminuit package, and I recommend that you familiarise yourself with their basic tutorial at https://iminuit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/basic_tutorial.html
